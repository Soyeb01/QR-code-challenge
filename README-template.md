## My process

First when I open my file I saw most of familiar files like .html, image file but when I saw downwards I see three more files which says README files and a style guide. First I got confused what to do and how to navigate from there. Then I figure it out. Then I started my journey of my first real time project.

I did this whole challenge in Visual Studio Code. I started with giving classes to my HTML syntax. After that I change the title and the name tag. And then after that I started CSS. I usually do in scss file and use an extention called Live Sass to use SCSS file. 

In my first try I did the whole project perfectly but I didn't like to much hard coding and also it's not look same in small display like mobile phones. Then I restart my whole CSS coding and first I revised flexbox more deeply and started my CSS code again.

I finally did my whole CSS coding and its more better than my previous code.
